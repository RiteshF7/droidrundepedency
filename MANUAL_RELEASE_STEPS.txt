MANUAL STEPS TO CREATE GITHUB RELEASE
================================================================================

Your GitHub token doesn't have 'repo' scope permissions, so you need to create
the release manually through the GitHub web interface.

STEP 1: Open GitHub Releases Page
-----------------------------------
Copy and paste this URL in your browser:
https://github.com/RiteshF7/droidrundepedency/releases/new

STEP 2: Fill in Release Information
------------------------------------
Tag version (REQUIRED):
    sourceversion1

Release title:
    Source Version 1

Description (copy and paste):
    Source packages archive with all standardized source files (24 packages)

    This archive contains 24 standardized source packages:
    - numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn
    - jiter, pyarrow, psutil, grpcio, pillow
    - tokenizers, safetensors, cryptography, pydantic-core, orjson
    - and more...

    All files are renamed to standardized names for easy recognition.

STEP 3: Upload the File
-----------------------
1. Click "Attach binaries by dropping them here or selecting them"
2. Navigate to: E:\Code\LunarLand\MiniLinux\droidrunBuild\depedencies\
3. Select the file: sourceversion1.7z (155 MB)
4. Wait for upload to complete (this may take a few minutes)

STEP 4: Publish
---------------
Click the green "Publish release" button at the bottom

STEP 5: Verify
--------------
After publishing, check:
https://github.com/RiteshF7/droidrundepedency/releases/tag/sourceversion1

The download URL will be:
https://github.com/RiteshF7/droidrundepedency/releases/download/sourceversion1/sourceversion1.7z

ALTERNATIVE: Fix Token Permissions (for future automated releases)
================================================================================

If you want to use automated scripts in the future:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" -> "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "droidrun-releases"
4. Select scope: "repo" (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token
7. Set it: export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
8. Then run: python update_release.py
