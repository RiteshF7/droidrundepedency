# Archived Scripts

This directory contains scripts that were removed during the consolidation process.

## Why These Scripts Were Removed

These scripts were identified as duplicates, obsolete, or superseded by more comprehensive scripts:

### Build Scripts
- **Duplicates:** Multiple scripts doing the same thing
- **Superseded:** Replaced by `install-droidrun-dependencies.sh` which is more comprehensive
- **Obsolete:** Old versions that are no longer maintained

### Monitor Scripts
- **Duplicates:** Multiple monitoring scripts with overlapping functionality
- **Merged:** Features consolidated into `show-build-progress.sh`

### Copy Scripts
- **Less Complete:** Replaced by more feature-rich versions in `utils/`

## Restoration

If you need to restore any of these scripts:
1. Copy from `archive/removed-scripts/` back to the appropriate directory
2. Update any references in other scripts or documentation
3. Test thoroughly as they may be outdated

## Reference

See `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` for detailed information about what was removed and why.
